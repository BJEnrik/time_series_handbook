# Chapter 2: Linear, Trend, and Momentum Forecasting

In this chapter we introduce basic tools on forecasting, which use simple algebraic formula. In the previous chapter, ARIMA was discussed where it forecasts the future values of a time series using its past or lagged values after removing the trends in the data. In this work, forecasting will be demonstrated while making use of the relationships and trends in the data.
