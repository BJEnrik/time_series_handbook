# Chapter 4: Granger Causality Test

In this chapter, we introduce the notion of causality and describe a test for linear models. The VAR model discussed in the previous chapter will be applied here.

The [notebook](04_GrangerCausality.ipynb) is outlined as follows: 
* Notations 
* Definitions 
* Assumptions 
* Testing for Granger Causality 
  * Ipo Dam Dataset 
    * Causality between Rainfall and Ipo Dam Water Level 
    * Causality between NIA Release Flow and Ipo Dam Water Level 
  * La Mesa Dam Dataset 
    * Causality between Rainfall and La Mesa Dam Water Level 
    * Causality between NIA Release Flow and La Mesa Dam Water Level 
* Jena Climate Data 
    * Causality between Pressure and Temperature
